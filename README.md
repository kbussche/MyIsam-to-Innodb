MyIsam-to-Innodb
================

Perl script to convert an entire database in mysql from Myisam to innodb.


Handy if you have a large amount of tables to convert.

- Script will go table by table.
- If the primary key is detectable the table will get re-ordred prior to the conversion

Use at your own risk.
